## About this Project

Tech Stacks: [ Javascript , Three Js Library, WebXR ] <br>

This project is made with Typescript, Three Js Library, WebXR. This app renders 3D objects in a AR Environment.
It has the Hit Point feature implemented which allow users to place the object on selected area. The Scale of the object is defined based on the Hit Point.
When I tested the project it worked on my devices well.But when i tested on few other devices i noticed it has device compatibility issue. <br>

### Issues with this app:
> AR Scene Renderer Doesn't Starts on few devices. <br><br>
> Real World Object Detection Camera doesn't shows up. <br><br>
> AR Scene renders on on webpage in some devices.<br><br>

### The possible reasons for this:
> The WebXR Api is Depricated. <br><br>
> Browser version doesn't satisfies WebXR requirements. <br><br>

While looking for the solutions for this issues i recreated this project with typescript. <a href="https://github.com/heysaadad/threejs-ts">See Here</a>
